    <P>
      Hello, my name is Nicolas and I try to write
      recreative computer programs for fun and non-profits,
      all of which I sometimes share below.  Tip: click on
      the date to obtain the permanant link to the log entry.
      <CODE>&copy; 2015-2025</CODE>.

    <P>
      You can contact me via electronic mailing at
      <CODE>nico@puffer.fish</CODE> and Mastodon at
      <CODE>@nico@puffer.fish</CODE>.  Some code of mine
      are available on-line.
    </P>

    <H2 ID="20250618">Give your computer systems some life.</H2>

    <P>
      <A HREF="#20250618">June 2025</A> &mdash; It's 1960,
      you are working your first job since you graduated.
      Between all the noises from computers and machines,
      you are there punching FORTRAN code on stock cards
      while waiting for the previous ones to compile.
      It has been a few hours, or maybe a day.  You don't
      really know since you must wait for the operator to
      call you back.  Don't you remember?  I don't because
      I wasn't alive in the sixties.
    </P>

    <P>
      Yet, I can feel the pain given the similarities to
      contemporary computer programming: write fancy code
      and wait tens of seconds, if not minutes, for it to
      compile, assuming incremental compilation!  Never
      will I try Chromium's hours-long compilation.
    </P>

    <P>
      This is slow, way too slow.  I know that optimisation
      introduce delays, but most of them are useless when
      programming.  Let me iterate instantly as Chuck Moore
      and Joe Armstrong could on off-world satellites
      oe telecommunication systems.  Some might argue that
      interactive programming is not always acceptable, but
      most systems written today aren't linear nor trivial.
      We need shorter feedback loops.
    </P>

    <P>
      A popular solution is reducing the build complexity
      to the point of eliminating build tools.  The Web
      community have illustrated the idea with the
      <CODE>#nobuild</CODE> movement, claiming that "you
      can't get faster than No Build".  Visual Basic people
      may look back at their golden age too.  Naive but it
      works: save the file and reload the page.  Tada!
    </P>

    <P>
      There are other possibilities.  I mentioned Erlang and
      FORTH yet we should not forget about kdb, SwiftUI, or
      <EM>live coding</EM> in general.  Look at the TOPLAP
      community and explain me why we cannot do the same?
    </P>

    <P>
      It's about trial and error, not fanciness; innately
      studying the situation to crack it; a better way of
      prototyping without the hassle of writing things
      twice or shipping the prototype.  The first draft is
      always wrong.  Even for governments, despite thousands
      of consultants and billions of dollars.  Iteration is
      key and living systems mold.
    </P>

    <P>
      Abstract over time and state, provide time travel
      debugging, hot module reloading with data migration,
      runtime introspection, and get inspired by Smalltalk.
      But remember that you are never starting from a blank
      slate.  You must interact with the state, explore the
      possibilities, and play with the system.
    </P>

    <H2 ID="20250617">Structural essence of number manipulation machinery.</H2>

    <P>
      <A HREF="#20250617">June 2025</A> &mdash; In the
      twelfth century, Persian mathematician Muhammad
      al-Khwarizmi started codifying the use of numbers and
      their various applications, leading to the notion of
      algorithms.  Today, we use algorithms everywhere: to
      automate processes, speed up boring work, or entertain
      us.  Yet, despite the years flying by and the rise of
      electronics, there is still an essential but often
      forgotten way of structuring algorithms which, when
      misunderstood, creates inefficient computing systems.
    </P>

    <P>
      For the moment, forget about Big O, Turing machines,
      and all the other formal stuff from academia, that is,
      let's focus not on the function but on the form of
      our ideas.  An algorithm is a sequence of steps, or
      at least I said so.  Whether it is sentences written
      on a page, boxes linked with arrows in a graphic, or
      mathematical functions in a computation machine,
      there will always be these steps and sequences.
    </P>

    <P>
      The steps form phases in a pipeline: if A is followed
      by B, then B shall not occur before A.  That is not
      to say the implementation of both A and B cannot be
      tasks happening concurrently, but it is that for the
      same data flowing within the pipeline, its treatment
      by step A should finish before step B starts.
    </P>

    <P>
      Naturally, this pipelining behaviour could be
      exploited to increase the raw performance and speed
      of the implementation, as it is in modern RISC
      micro-computers and real-time software: when processing
      the third step of the pipeline on some data, you can
      also be processing the second step for the next data,
      while the fourth step is processing the previous data.
      One may even go further by trying to do runtime
      analysis of data dependencies to dynamically execute
      steps out of order and achieve more optimal execution.
    </P>

    <P>
      But be advised not to be too crazy!  Especially, do
      not disguise the pipeline as something it is not.
      Maybe your data represents actors in a scene, sending
      messages to one another; but the algorithm certainly
      isn't.  And remember Niklaus Wirth's <EM>"Algorithms
      + Data Structures = Programs" </EM>, an idea he
      believed in so strongly that it became the eponym of
      one of his books.
    </P>

    <P>
      And when it comes to the function, that's the place
      where you should be thinking about your algorithm's
      properties: from determinism or scaling to
      statefulness versus statelessness.  They are inherited
      from your needs, not universals.  But one universal
      is for sure that one shouldn't hide from the pipe.
    </P>
